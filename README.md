# workbench
My personal Project foundation build with psr-standards, extensions and template support.

## Idea
This framework is mainly based on a bunch of patterns that helps building a solid foundation for my projects. The main idea is, that every project is a collection of extensions, which form the resulting website, blog, web application. All with extensibility from the start in mind. This may help you to collaborate with others on your project, or maybe it helps you to understand some common patterns or solutions.
